              Vanessa is a current M.A. and B.A. candidate in Sociology on the Data Science, 
              Markets and Management Track with a double minor in Human Rights and Education at 
              Stanford University with an anticipated graduation year of 2023, and a 2020 Chappell 
              Lougee Scholar. Her research interests primarily focus on advocating for indigenous 
              rights in Southeast Asia, the LGBTQ+ community, education equity through policy and 
              outreach for marginalized communities, and all of its intersectionality. Social identity 
              being constantly accompanied by the social structure and contexts surrounding it further 
              inspires Vanessa to navigate how colorism plays an integral aspect in navigating their own 
              life, developing research, and position in academia. Vanessa grew up predominantly in Fairfield, 
              Ohio, eating yao hon and lychees with family on special occasions, while thinking about the next 
              time they can go rock climbing.
